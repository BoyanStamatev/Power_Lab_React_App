Project Specification

"Power Lab" is a web application for a food additives web shop. 
The client side is a single page app, dynamically updating with React, using JSX, React JS and Bootstrap.
The server is built on Express JS and it is using Mongo Db for storing the data. Redux is used as a state management library.
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. 
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. 
The application consists of users, food products and orders. Each user can register, login and logout. 
Users can also search for the food they are looking for, view each power details and make orders. 
Admins can add, edit and delete food additives entries and approve orders.
